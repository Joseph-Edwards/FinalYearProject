# An Introduction To Colour Refinement
In this repository, you will find several bits of code that I have written as part of my final year project on colour refinement.

## Contents of the repository
 - In [colour_refinement.py](colour_refinement.py), you will find an implementation of the colour refinement algoirthm presented in [[1]](#1), and an implementation
 of an algorithm that checks for amenability presented in [[2]](#2), along with a function that performs the "jellyfishification process".
 - In [J_12_properties.ipynb](J_12_properties.ipynb), you will find a discussion and verification of some of the colour refinement properties of the graph $J_{12}$; an
 asymmetric, planar, non-amenable, non-regular, simple spectrum graph.
 - In [dissertation_examples.py](dissertation_examples.py), you will find some examples of graphs that appear in my project write-up, and the calculation of some of their
 properties.
 - In [RENAME ME](RENAME ME), you fill find the code used to enumerate all small graphs, and select the ones with various nice properties.
